Two programs, server.c and client.c will perform the bench marking
Both of these programs will need a bridge in order to effectively 
test the progpagation delay through the various network layers.

Server will send a packet to Client and then Client will simply echo the
packet back. The total round trip time will be calculated. As of now, perform
about 10-100 tests and calculate the average.

TODO:
-init bridge
-client.c
    -build a simple program using unix sockets to verify bridge works
    -move over unix socket apis to Go apis
-sever.c
    -build a simple program using unix sockets to verify bridge works
    -move over unix socket apis to Go apis
